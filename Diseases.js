    description: [
      "Ringworm is a very common and highly transmissible skin infection, passed between both cattle and humans.It causes intense irritation and can affect growth rates and damage hides, but steps can be taken to prevent it.Ringworm is a fungal skin disease caused most commonly by the spore forming fungi trichophyton verrucosum.Cattle are the most commonly affected farm animal species. Affected animals usually have roughly circular areas of hair loss where the skin becomes slightly thickened, crusty and flaky and grayish in color.",
      "These areas are often seen on the face, around the eyes and over the shoulders, although all areas of the body, including the udder, can become affected and the areas affected can be extensive.",
    ],
    causes: [
      "Ringworm is a transmissible infectious skin disease caused most often by Trichophyton verrucosum, a spore forming fungi.",
      "The spores can remain alive for years in a dry environment. It occurs in all species of mammals including cattle and man. Although unsightly, fungal infections cause little permanent damage or economic loss. Direct contact with infected animals is the most common method of spreading the infection.",
    ],
    symptoms: [
      "Grey-white areas of skin with an ash like surface.",
      "Usually circular in outline and slightly raised.",
      "Size of lesions very variable, can become very extensive.",
      "In calves most commonly found around eyes, on ears and on back, in adult cattle chest and legs more common.",
    ],
    treatment: [
      "Ringworm will usually heal itself without treatment, however this can take up to nine months.",
      "Topical treatment, application of the medication directly onto the lesion, is the usual procedure. Medication cannot penetrate the crusts; the crusts should be removed by scraping or brushing. They should be collected and burned to avoid contaminating the premises. Lesions should be treated at least twice, three to five days apart.",
    ],
    vaccine: [
      "A vaccine, called Bovilis Ringvac, is available to protect cattle against ringworm and to hasten recovery.",
      "Two doses of vaccine, with dose volume dependent on the age of the animals being vaccinated, are required to be given by intramuscular injection with an interval of two weeks between them. Immunity is achieved by three weeks after the second dose.",

      "Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is a severe, highly contagious viral disease of livestock that has a significant economic impact. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep, goats and other cloven-hoofed ruminants. It is a transboundary animal disease (TAD) that deeply affect the production of livestock and disrupting regional and international trade in animals and animal products. The disease is estimated to circulate in 77% of the global livestock population, in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, as well as in a limited area of South America.",
    ],
    causes: [
      "The disease is caused by a virus of which there are seven types, each producing the same symptoms, and distinguishable only in the laboratory.",
      "Airborne spread of the disease can take place and under favorable weather conditions the disease may be spread considerable distances by this route.",
      "Animals pick up the virus either by direct contact with an infected animal or by contact with foodstuffs or other things which have been contaminated by such an animal, or by eating or coming into contact with some part of an infected carcase.",
      "The disease can also be spread by people, vehicles and other objects that have been contaminated by the virus.",
      "Outbreaks have been linked with the importation of infected meat and meat products.",

    symptoms: [
      "Fever",

      "Quivering lips and frothing of mouth",
      "Cows may develop blisters on teats",
      "Lameness",

    treatment: [
      "Treatment is not given. Affected animals will recover. However because of the loss of production and the infectious state of the disease, infected animals are usually culled.",

    treatment: [
      "Antibiotic therapy, fly control and management of environmental factors are the best methods of treatment.",
      "Moving cattle to a new pasture may help decrease fly pressure and create more space between cattle.",
      "Most bacterial pathogens implicated in pinkeye are susceptible to antibiotic therapy. Long-acting antibiotics with label claims for pinkeye include oxytetracycline and tulathromycin. No label claims are available for the treatment or prevention of pinkeye with the use of medicated feed antibiotics.",
      "Covering the eye with a cloth patch glued over the face may help make the animal more comfortable by decreasing the sunlight irritation.More importantly, it helps decrease the spread of the disease by preventing flies from getting to the infected eye secretions.",
      "Good management practices may increase the rate of healing and decrease the spread of infection.",
      "Separating affected cattle and providing them a shaded area with accessible food and water lowers the animals stress and allows them to heal more efficiently.",
